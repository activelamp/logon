    <h1>Creating a UCLA Logon ID</h1>

    <p>The standard default format of a UCLA Logon is the
    first letter of your first name followed by up to 14 characters of your
    last name. However, you may choose any available username.</p>

    <p>Your username must be between 2 and 15 characters in length. All usernames
    must begin with a letter. The remaining characters can consist of any
    combination of letters and numbers.  All letters default to lowercase.
    Both usernames must match. Because usernames are permanent, most iterations
    of common names have probably already been used. If you are having
    trouble selecting a username, please continue trying alternates.</p>

    <h2>Choosing your password</h2>

    <p>Passwords must be between 8 and 128 characters in length and must contain
    a minimum of 1 letter, and 1 number or special character. Both passwords
    entered must match. Passwords will not appear as you type. Please note
    that unlike usernames, <strong>passwords are case sensitive</strong>.  Valid
    characters can consist of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and any
    characters from the following set: !@#$%^&amp;*().,</p>

    <p>Your password is used to safeguard access to your account. You
    will want to select something that is both easy for you to remember and
    hard for someone else to guess.</p>

    <h2>Challenge Question & Response</h2>

    <p>Select a challenge and response phrase so that should you forget
    your password in the future, you may reset it online.</p>

    <p>The Challenge phrase must be at least 8 characters long and may not
    exceed 128 characters.</p>

    <p>The Response phrase is <strong>case sensitive</strong>.
    It can not be the same as your Challenge phrase. It must be at least
    8 characters long and may not exceed 128 characters.</p>
