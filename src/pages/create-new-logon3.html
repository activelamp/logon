      <h2>Choosing your username</h2>
      
      <p>Your username must be between 3 and 15 characters in length. All usernames
      must begin with a letter. The remaining characters can consist of any
      combination of letters and numbers.  All letters default to lowercase.
      Both usernames must match. Because usernames are permanent, most iterations
      of common names have probably already been used. If you are having
      trouble selecting a username, please continue trying alternates.</p>
  
      <h2>Choosing your password</h2>
  
      <p>Passwords must be between 8 and 128 characters in length and must contain
      a minimum of 1 letter, and 1 number or special character. Both passwords
      entered must match. Passwords will not appear as you type. Please note
      that unlike usernames, <strong>passwords are case sensitive</strong>.  Valid
      characters can consist of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and any
      characters from the following set: !@#$%^&amp;*().,</p>
  
      <p>Your password is used to safeguard access to your account. You
      will want to select something that is both easy for you to remember and
      hard for someone else to guess.</p>
  
      <h2>Selecting Challenge Question & Response</h2>
  
      <p>Select a challenge and response phrase so that should you forget
      your password in the future, you may reset it online.</p>
  
      <p>The Challenge phrase must be at least 8 characters long and may not
      exceed 128 characters.</p>
  
      <p>The Response phrase is <strong>case sensitive</strong>.
      It can not be the same as your Challenge phrase. It must be at least
      8 characters long and may not exceed 128 characters.</p>
